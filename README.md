## Clean Chrome Page

Designed by **NÃ©vio Costa Magagnin**, this is a simple page with the current time in the middle of the screen and fast Google links at the top of the page.

To **configure** it, open your Google Chrome and go under `Settings > Startup > Open a specific page or set of pages > Add a new page` and than place the URL `https://nevi0.github.io/clean-chrome-page/`.

And... that's it! **Enjoy!** :grin:
