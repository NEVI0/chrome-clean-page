## :leaves: Clean Chrome Page

Designed by **Névio Costa Magagnin**, this is a simple page with a time in the middle of the screen and Google links.

To **configure** it, open your Google Chrome and go under ´Settings > Startup > Open a specific page or set of pages > Add a new page´ and than place the URL ´https://nevi0.github.io/clean-chrome-page/´.

And... that's it! **Enjoy!** :grin:
